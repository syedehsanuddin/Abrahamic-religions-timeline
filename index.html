                            Until Kossay's time, the different Koraishite families had lived dispersed in separate

                            distances from the Kaaba, and the extreme sanctity they
                            attached to the temple had prevented their erecting any habitation
                            in its neighbourhood. Perceiving the dangers to which the national
                            pantheon was exposed from its unprotected condition, he induced
                            the Koraish to settle in its vicinity, leavinga sufficient space free on the four sides of
                            the temple for the tawaf (circumambulation).
                            The families, to whom the lands were allotted, dwelt in strongly fortified quarters.

                        <p class="footer__text">
                            Kossay appears to have made himself the master of Mecca
                            about the middle of the fifth century of the Christian era, and he at once set himself to
                            the task of placing the administration of the
                            city upon an organised basis.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            Kossay built for himself a palace, the door of which opened on
                            the platform of the temple. This palace was called the Dar un Nadwa, "The council
                            hall" ,where, under the presidency of
                            Kossay, public affairs were discussed and transacted. To this hall,
                            no man under the age of forty, unless a descendant of Kossay,
                            could gain admission. Here also were performed all civil functions.
                            At the Dar un-Nadwa, the Koraishites, when about to engage in
                            a war, received from the hands of Kossay the standard, Liwa. Kossay
                            himself attached to the end of a lance a piece of white stuff, and
                            handed it, or sent it by one of his sons, to the Koraishite chiefs.
                            This ceremony, called the Akd ul-liwa, continued in vogue from the
                            time of its inauguration by Kossay until the very end of the Arab
                            empire.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Another of Kossay's institutions endured much longer.
                            By representing to the Koraish the necessity of providing food for
                            the poor pilgrims who annually visited Mecca, and by impressing
                            on them the duties of hospitality, Kossay succeeded in making them
                            submit to the payment of an annual poor-tax, called the Rifada,
                            which he applied in feeding the poorer pilgrims during the Ayyam ul-Mina -the day of the
                            sacrificialfeast, and the two following days
                            which they passed at Mina. This usage continued after the establishment
                            of Islam, and was the origin of the distribution of food which
                            was made at Mina. each year during the pilgrimage, in the name of
                            the Caliphs and the Sultans,their successors.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            With these dignities, Kossay also held the administration
                            of the water suppliedby the wells in Mecca and its neighbourhood
                            "Sikaya", and the custodyof the keys of the Kaaba "Hijaba", with
                            the ministration to the worshipof the gods.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Kossay thus united in his own person all the principal religious,
                            civil, and political functions. He was king, magistrate, and chief
                            pontiff. His power, which was almost royal, threw great lustre on
                            the tribe of Koraish, of whom he was the acknowledged chief, and
                            from his time the Koraish acquired a marked preponderance among
                            the other descendants of Ishmael.
