                            tradition, he and his wife Hawwa (Eve) are the first human beings and the first prophets.
                            While the Hebrew Bible does not explicitly mention Adam as a prophet in Judaism, he is
                            recognized as the first human created by God. In Christianity, Adam and Eve's story is
                            fundamental to the doctrine of original sin, which has implications for Christian beliefs
                            about salvation.</p>

                            the previous scriptures, including the Torah.

                            holds profound importance for all three religions. In Judaism, the giving of the law forms
                            the basis of the covenant between God and the Jewish people. In Christianity, the Ten
                            Commandments are foundational moral principles, and the role of the law in God's plan is
                            central to Christian theology. In Islam, the event is seen as the bestowal of guidance and
                            law by God to Prophet Moses and is revered as a testament to divine wisdom.</p>

                            The liberation of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery, led by Prophet Moses, is a shared
                            event of great significance. It underscores the themes of liberation, divine intervention,
                            and the fulfillment of God's promises. The Exodus is central to the Passover festival in
                            Judaism, remembered in the Seder meal. In Christianity, the symbolism of liberation and the
                            fulfillment of God's plan through Jesus is closely tied to the Exodus. In Islam, it is
                            recognized as an important event, demonstrating God's deliverance of the oppressed.</p>

                            Christianity, is considered a righteous king and a prophet in Islam. His son Solomon is
                            revered for his wisdom and in all three religions for his role in constructing the First

                            The Psalms, attributed to Prophet David, are recognized in all three faiths. They are a
                            collection of sacred hymns and poetry that hold a special place in worship and reflection.
                            In Judaism, the Book of Psalms is central to prayer and liturgy. In Christianity, the Psalms
                            are part of the Old Testament and continue to be used in worship and meditation. In Islam,
                            the Psalms are acknowledged as a revelation to David and serve as a source of spiritual
                            guidance.</p>

                            The concept of the Messiah is a point of division. In Judaism, the Messiah is an awaited
                            future figure who will bring redemption. In Christianity, Jesus is considered the Messiah.
                            In Islam, there is no concept of a Messiah in the same way, and Jesus is viewed as a
                            prophet, not the Messiah.</p>

                        <p class="footer__text">Messiah: <br>
                            The covenant made between God and King David, promising an eternal throne and kingdom, is
                            significant in all three religions. In Judaism, this covenant is the basis for the belief in
                            the Messiah from the Davidic line. In Christianity, the covenant is linked to Jesus, who is
                            often referred to as the "Son of David." In Islam, the covenant reflects God's favor upon
                            David as a prophet and king.</p>

                                primarily in the Old Testament, where his wisdom and reign are described. In the New

                                theology is on Jesus as the Messiah.

                            associated with King David.

                            While the interpretations differ, the birth of Jesus holds a special
                            place in all three faiths. In Islam, it is acknowledged as a miraculous birth to the Virgin
                            Mary and is a testament to God's power. In Christianity, the birth of Jesus is central to
                            the faith, representing the incarnation of God's Word. In some Jewish traditions, Jesus is
                            recognized as a historical figure.</p>

                            This is a significant point of divergence. In Christianity, Jesus is believed to be the Son
                            of God and divine. In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet, not divine. This fundamental
                            theological difference has been a source of division for centuries.</p>

                            The crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus are central to Christian belief. In Islam, there
                            are differing interpretations regarding whether Jesus was crucified. Some Muslims believe
                            that he was not crucified, while others accept the event but not the theological
                            significance.</p>

                <p class="footer__textv3">Note: While this website aims to provide an overview of the origins of three
                    major religions stemming from the legacy of Abraham—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—it is important
                    to acknowledge the rich diversity within each faith. Variations in beliefs, practices, and
                    interpretations exist among different denominations, such as Shia and Sunni within Islam, Catholic
                    and Protestant within Christianity, and different perspectives within Judaism, including Orthodox,
                    Conservative, and Reform. Additionally, Unitarians and other sects contribute to the multifaceted
                    nature of religious traditions. It is crucial to recognize and respect the diversity of religious
                    views and perspectives, as individuals and communities may hold unique interpretations and
                    traditions within the broader framework of these faiths.</p>
