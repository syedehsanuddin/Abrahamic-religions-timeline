                            tradition, he and his wife Hawwa (Eve) are the first human beings and the first prophets.
                            While the Hebrew Bible does not explicitly mention Adam as a prophet in Judaism, he is
                            recognized as the first human created by God. In Christianity, Adam and Eve's story is
                            fundamental to the doctrine of original sin, which has implications for Christian beliefs
                            about salvation.</p>

                            from Egyptian slavery and received the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai.</p>

                            his lawgiving role is acknowledged.

                        <p class="footer__text"> The significance of Moses varies among the religions. In Judaism, he is
                            a central figure, while in Christianity, the focus shifts to Jesus as the central figure. In
                            Islam, Moses is a highly respected prophet but not as central as Muhammad.

                        <p class="footer__text"> The interpretation and role of the Mosaic Law differ. In Judaism, the
                            Torah remains a central religious text. In Christianity, the New Testament contains the
                            teachings of Jesus, and the role of Mosaic Law is debated. In Islam, the Quran supersedes
                            the previous scriptures, including the Torah.

                        <p class="footer__text">The Exodus: <br>
                            The revelation of the divine law, the Ten Commandments, on Mount Sinai is another event that
                            holds profound importance for all three religions. In Judaism, the giving of the law forms
                            the basis of the covenant between God and the Jewish people. In Christianity, the Ten
                            Commandments are foundational moral principles, and the role of the law in God's plan is
                            central to Christian theology. In Islam, the event is seen as the bestowal of guidance and
                            law by God to Prophet Moses and is revered as a testament to divine wisdom.</p>

                            The liberation of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery, led by Prophet Moses, is a shared
                            event of great significance. It underscores the themes of liberation, divine intervention,
                            and the fulfillment of God's promises. The Exodus is central to the Passover festival in
                            Judaism, remembered in the Seder meal. In Christianity, the symbolism of liberation and the
                            fulfillment of God's plan through Jesus is closely tied to the Exodus. In Islam, it is
                            recognized as an important event, demonstrating God's deliverance of the oppressed.</p>

                            In Judaism, the Book of Psalms is central to prayer and liturgy. In Christianity, the Psalms
                            are part of the Old Testament and continue to be used in worship and meditation. In Islam,

                            In Islam, there is no concept of a Messiah in the same way, and Jesus is viewed as a
                            prophet, not the Messiah.</p>

                                becoming the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel, following King Saul. He is

                    major religions stemming from the legacy of Abraham—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—it is important
                    to acknowledge the rich diversity within each faith. Variations in beliefs, practices, and
                    interpretations exist among different denominations, such as Shia and Sunni within Islam, Catholic
                    and Protestant within Christianity, and different perspectives within Judaism, including Orthodox,
                    Conservative, and Reform. Additionally, Unitarians and other sects contribute to the multifaceted
                    nature of religious traditions. It is crucial to recognize and respect the diversity of religious
                    views and perspectives, as individuals and communities may hold unique interpretations and
                    traditions within the broader framework of these faiths.</p>

                                    Kossay, public affairs were discussed and transacted. To this hall,

                                    could gain admission. Here also were performed all civil functions.

                                    a war, received from the hands of Kossay the standard, Liwa. Kossay
                                    himself attached to the end of a lance a piece of white stuff, and
                                    handed it, or sent it by one of his sons, to the Koraishite chiefs.
                                    This ceremony, called the Akd ul-liwa, continued in vogue from the
                                    time of its inauguration by Kossay until the very end of the Arab
                                    empire.

                                    Another of Kossay's institutions endured much longer.
                                    By representing to the Koraish the necessity of providing food for
                                    the poor pilgrims who annually visited Mecca, and by impressing
                                    on them the duties of hospitality, Kossay succeeded in making them
                                    submit to the payment of an annual poor-tax, called the Rifada,
                                    which he applied in feeding the poorer pilgrims during the Ayyam ul-Mina -the day of
                                    the
                                    sacrificialfeast, and the two following days
                                    which they passed at Mina. This usage continued after the establishment
                                    of Islam, and was the origin of the distribution of food which
                                    was made at Mina. each year during the pilgrimage, in the name of
                                    the Caliphs and the Sultans,their successors.

                                    <br>
                                    With these dignities, Kossay also held the administration
                                    of the water suppliedby the wells in Mecca and its neighbourhood
                                    "Sikaya", and the custodyof the keys of the Kaaba "Hijaba", with
                                    the ministration to the worshipof the gods.

                                    Kossay thus united in his own person all the principal religious,
                                    civil, and political functions. He was king, magistrate, and chief
                                    pontiff. His power, which was almost royal, threw great lustre on
                                    the tribe of Koraish, of whom he was the acknowledged chief, and
                                    from his time the Koraish acquired a marked preponderance among
                                    the other descendants of Ishmael.
